        We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are a minor under 18, we recommend you to register or attempt to register for any of our products, services, websites and applications or send any of your personal information to us if and only if you have acquired prior consent from a person with parental responsibilities for you, such as your parents.

    </p>

    <p>
        If you believe that we might have collected Personal Information from your minor whom you have parental responsibility with and would like to request us to delete the personal information of your minor, please contact us.

    <h2>
        DATA WE COLLECT OTHER THAN PERSONAL INFORMATION
    </h2>

        RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA
    </h2>

    <p>
        Dennings reserves the right to retain your Personal Information, other data collected about you and content you submit to or through the Dennings Service to the extent required by applicable laws, rules and regulations and as reasonably necessary to protect our legal interests and operate our business.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dennings will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will take all practicable steps to ensure that your personal information is not kept longer than is necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>
        DATA TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE
    </h2>

    <p>
        No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dennings uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Dennings Service. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and that limit others’ use or disclosure of your Personal Information but we would not disclose the agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>
        ACCESS AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
    </h2>

    <p>
        Your personal information will be kept in our database for a reasonable period. If you are the subject of the personal information, you have the right to check whether we hold your personal information, to obtain a copy of such information and to correct any related information which is inaccurate or outdated.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may also request to delete your personal information. However, Dennings aims to maintain our services in a manner that protects your personal information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you have deleted your personal information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and remove information from our backup systems. Dennings will remove the information you have deleted within reasonable time if such information is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes for which the information is used. If you have request, please send us.
    </p>

    <p>
        When updating or deleting your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dennings may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
    </p>

        INTERNATIONAL USE
